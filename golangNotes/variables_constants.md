## Variables and constants in Go

# Variables -
- Used for storing values which be changed/updated later if required.
- Give the variable name and reference everywhere in the app
- Update the value at one location and it will get updated where variable is referenced.
- Make our app more flexible
- If variable is declared but not used in the program, compiler shows warning for it.


# Constants -
- Constants are like variables, except that their values cannot be changed once declared
  in the program.
